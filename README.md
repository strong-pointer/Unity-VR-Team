# Unity-VR-Team
My semester-long Unity OpenXR VR team-based project
______________________________________________________
My team and I had worked side-by-side to complete this group team project of a Technological History museum that would not be possible to experience in the real world. We had set out on those terms from the beginning, hoping to enrich our users with a unique experience inside of Virtual Reality so that they could learn about our technological advancements throughout history while simultaneously having fun.

A teleportation locomotion method was chosen over others after carefully considering the pros and cons of each we had available to us.

All of the scripting and VR integration was done by me, and I had also done the entirety of the work inside of the Hub (initial room) and Late Middle Ages. The other 3 rooms/scenes were made by my group mates, with my assistance in final revisions and VR/XR functionality.
